## Hi there 👋
I'm Miguel A. Gonzalez Almonte

**AI Systems Builder • GPT Workflow Architect • Python Developer • Operational Technologist**

Welcome to my GitHub — a home for tools I've built to turn **operational complexity into clean, logic-based systems**. I design and develop intelligent assistants, internal tools, and lifecycle-driven platforms using Python, GPT agents, and modern coordination logic.

---

## 🔧 What I Do

I build systems that:
- Replace spreadsheets with **decision-safe workflows**
- Empower non-technical users with **instructive AI interfaces**
- Enforce **lifecycle logic** and **state clarity** across tools
- Deploy quickly using modular design and real-world coordination rules

Though I’ve never held a traditional software title, my tools are **used in production** — by real teams, under pressure, delivering real results.
